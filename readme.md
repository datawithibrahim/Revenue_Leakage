# CRM Sales & Revenue Leakage Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end business analytics case study** built using CRM sales data.  
The goal of this project is **not just to build dashboards**, but to **identify real business problems, explain why they are happening, and support data-driven decisions**.

The analysis focuses on two major business areas:
1. **Revenue Leakage & Funnel Inefficiencies**
2. **Overall Sales Performance & Growth Insights**

The final output is delivered through **interactive Power BI dashboards** designed for decision-makers.

## Business Context

Many organizations using CRM systems face challenges such as:
- High deal volume but low conversion
- Revenue loss due to discounting or weak deal control
- Long and inconsistent sales cycles
- Over-dependence on a few sales agents
- Poor visibility into where deals are failing

This project uses data analytics to **diagnose these problems instead of just reporting numbers**.

---

## Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning, EDA, time-series analysis  
- **SQL** – Business-focused diagnostic queries  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and storytelling  
- **CRM Sales Dataset** – Accounts, Products, Sales Pipeline, Sales Teams

## Dashboard 1: Revenue Leakage Analysis

### Purpose
To identify **where revenue is being lost**, **why it is happening**, and **which areas need corrective action**.

### Key KPIs
- Total Revenue  
- Total Deals  
- Closed Deals  
- Win Rate (%)  
- Revenue Leakage  

### Key Insights Enabled
- Funnel stages with the highest deal loss  
- Products causing high revenue leakage due to discounting  
- Industries contributing to leakage  
- Relationship between sales cycle length and deal success  

### Business Questions Answered
- Are we losing revenue due to process issues or pricing issues?
- At which sales stage do deals fail the most?
- Which products or sectors erode margins?

## Dashboard 2: Sales Analysis

### Purpose
To evaluate **sales performance, growth drivers, and operational efficiency** across products, regions, and sales agents.

### Key KPIs
- Total Deals  
- Average Deal Size  
- Revenue by Product  
- Revenue by Sales Agent  

### Key Visuals & What They Reveal
- **Revenue by Product:** Identifies top-performing and underperforming products  
- **Deals by Product:** Highlights volume vs value mismatch  
- **Sales Agent Ranking:** Shows revenue concentration and dependency risk  
- **Geographic Revenue Map:** Reveals regional performance differences  

### Business Questions Answered
- Which products drive revenue vs just volume?
- Is revenue dependent on a small group of sales agents?
- Which regions contribute most to revenue leakage?
- Are we scaling sales sustainably?

---

## Key Business Insights

- Revenue leakage is primarily driven by **product pricing and deal-level discounting**
- Certain funnel stages consistently show high deal losses, indicating **process gaps**
- Revenue is concentrated among a few sales agents, creating **scalability and risk concerns**
- Some products generate high deal volume but low revenue impact
- Sales cycle length varies significantly, affecting cash flow predictability

---

## Business Recommendations

- Improve early-stage deal qualification to reduce fake pipeline
- Review pricing strategy for high-leakage products
- Reduce dependency on top sales agents through standardization and training
- Balance strategy between fast-closing deals (cash flow) and large deals (growth)
- Monitor sales cycle trends to improve operational efficiency
